# VirtualGraffiti

# Idea
The original concept of VirtualGraffiti was to create an Augmented Reality application to allow users to create a drawing, position it in three dimensional space, and view it through AR in perspective in real-time.

# Execution
This app lets a user take a picture, draw on it, and save it to a geolocation. 
Users can then click on the pin at the location to see the picture with the drawing superimposed over it.

# Future
If there is time, We left room to implement the AR capabilities of the app.
This would include displaying the camera preview in real-time, and rendering an image as an object probably using something like THREE.js
